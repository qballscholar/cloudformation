# I need a simple summary of the attached cloudformation template clarifying what the stack is and what it is good for in purpose. keep it brief and professional

This CloudFormation template provisions foundational AWS infrastructure suitable for basic web application hosting and development environments. It creates the following key resources:

- A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with public and private subnets across two Availability Zones, enabling high availability and network segmentation.
- An Internet Gateway, route tables, and associations to allow internet access for public subnets while keeping private subnets isolated.
- A security group permitting HTTP (port 80) and SSH (port 22) access to an EC2 instance.
- An IAM role granting EC2 instances read-only access to S3 buckets.
- A single EC2 instance (Amazon Linux 2023) in a public subnet, automatically configured as a web server with Apache HTTPD and a sample web page.

**Purpose:**
This stack is designed to quickly establish a secure, scalable, and internet-accessible environment for running web servers or similar workloads. It is ideal for learning, prototyping, or as a starting point for more complex infrastructure deployments.
